/** Brutus Attack's own client-side state. brutusRsn/npcId/idleAnimationId/walkAnimationId are
 * folded from PLAYER_TRANSFORMED (see that event's own doc), real state applied catch-up or not --
 * a catching-up client must know who's currently transformed just as much as one that was already
 * connected. roundNumber/roundStartAt are folded from BRUTUS_ROUND_STARTED, the same
 * single-stamp-off-a-round's-own-event shape RepeatAfterMePresentation's own roundStartAt uses --
 * anchors this round's own local DASH_DURATION_MS countdown. eliminatedRsns is real state too,
 * applied catch-up or not, same shape HotPotatoPresentation's own eliminatedRsns uses; see
 * PlayerOverlay's own drawBrutusAttackTargetToken, which reverts a still-listed rsn's own bullseye
 * back to a plain token the instant it's added here.
 * <p>
 * <b>No continuous position pinging, and no target ever reports its own position at all</b> --
 * see onTick, called once per game tick while this mini-game is active (RunePartyPlugin#
 * onGameTick). Two one-shot, position-free reports: confirmBrutusArrival, fired once by Brutus and
 * once by each target the instant its own client locally detects standing on its own required
 * zone's colored tile this round (a plain readiness signal -- nobody's actual position is ever
 * needed for arrival at all). confirmBrutusDash, fired once, only by Brutus, the instant his own
 * client detects landing on the target-zone tile -- carrying his own real position this time,
 * since that IS the moment that matters.
 * <p>
 * The elimination decision itself lives entirely client-side, on each TARGET's own machine, not on
 * the server and not via anyone's own recorded arrival spot (an earlier iteration tried both of
 * those and hit real problems -- a frozen arrival position going stale the instant a target moved,
 * then a move-triggered re-report that worked but still needed a target to keep talking to the
 * server at all). Brutus's own confirmBrutusDash report is broadcast back out to every other seated
 * client same as any other event (BRUTUS_DASH_REPORTED, folded below) -- each one independently
 * checks its OWN real position against it the instant it arrives (RunePartyPlugin#
 * isLocalPlayerHitByBrutusDash, same BRUTUS_HITBOX_RADIUS_TILES-wide match the server itself used
 * to do), and calls confirmBrutusElimination only if it actually finds a match. A target that
 * never gets hit and never leaves its own zone sends nothing at all past its own one arrival
 * report for the round -- one that walks back out of its own zone once the round's actually active
 * sends exactly one more, confirmLeftZone (see onTick's own doc) -- a deliberately silent
 * self-elimination, not a "HIT!".
 * confirmedArrivalThisRound/dashReportedThisRound guard Brutus's own two one-shot reports;
 * targetConfirmedArrivalThisRound guards a target's own single arrival report the same way. All
 * three reset on BRUTUS_ARRIVAL_PENDING, which the server fires right before each of the 3 rounds'
 * own gathering begins, so everyone reports fresh every round even if nobody physically moved. See
 * minigames/brutus_attack.py's own doc for the full reasoning on why none of this bothers verifying
 * anything server-side either (the stakes here -- a flat coin reward -- don't warrant guarding
 * against a spoofed report).
 * <p>
 * dashResultBannerUntil/dashResultWasHit drive AnnouncementOverlay's own "HIT!"/"MISS!" flash --
 * armed the instant either BRUTUS_PLAYER_ELIMINATED (a hit) or BRUTUS_DASH_MISSED (a miss) lands,
 * live only (never for a catching-up client replaying history), same gating RunePartyPlugin's own
 * dedicated cases elsewhere in this codebase already give a one-shot cosmetic reveal. */
